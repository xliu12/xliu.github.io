## Welcome to Xiao Liu's Page

I am a PhD student in [Quantitative Psyhology](https://psychology.nd.edu/graduate-programs/areas-of-study/quantitative/) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu). 

My research interests include mediation analysis, longitudinal data analysis, causal inference, study design (e.g., sample size planning), and Bayesian methods.
Here is my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CSsYefBY4cCtapWNsrxidVTFnJzE4GuhN03QzjasTSM/edit?usp=sharing).
